<h3 align="center">Remake of the VALORANT extension launcher, Assist.</h3>

## Why make a remake?
Why not? Assist's custom Valnet library is obfuscated, meaning you can't add new agents or fix bugs if the software is outdated!
Assist Remake (in short, Assistr) solves this problem by making everything truly open source! Feel free to contribute to this repo as much as you wish :D
