<h3 align="center">Recreation of the VALORANT extension launcher, Assist.</h3>

## Why make a remake?
Why not? Assist's custom Valnet library is obfuscated, meaning you can't add new agents or fix bugs if the software is outdated! The only thing open-source is the front-end!
Assist Remake (in short, Assistr) solves this problem by hiding absolutely nothing because im absolute shei at coding. Feel free to contribute to this repo as much as you wish :D
## What stuff does this remake depend on?
Well, we have [ValAPI.Net](https://github.com/brianbaldner/ValAPI.Net).
